# Quantum Geometric Framework (QGF)

A categorical and entanglement-based theory of emergent spacetime, gravity, and matter.  
QGF proposes that geometry and field dynamics emerge from the entanglement structure of quantum states. It is constructed using tensor networks, modular tensor categories, and information-theoretic principles, reconstructing spacetime from mutual information, modular flow, and fusion algebra.

## Features of QGF

- Reconstructs geometry from normalized mutual information  
- Modular time defines causal and dynamical structure  
- Einstein field equations derived from entanglement variation  
- Matter/gauge fields from modular fusion objects  
- RG flow recovers GR (IR) and QFT (UV) behavior  
- Fully falsifiable with predictions for \( n_s \), \( r \), PBHs, and rare decays
