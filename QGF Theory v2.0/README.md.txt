Quantum Geometric Framework (QGF)
A categorical and entanglement-based theory of emergent spacetime, gravity, matter, and cosmology.

Version
v2.0 – Structural and Empirical Completion Includes modular tensor simulations, fusion algebra for SU(2)_2 × SU(3)_3, constraint closure, scalar power spectrum (n_s = 0.964), and full categorical embedding of the Standard Model.

Overview
QGF is a background-independent theoretical framework in which spacetime and field content emerge from the algebraic and entanglement structure of modular tensor categories. It integrates quantum information theory, category theory, and renormalization flow to reconstruct general relativity, the Standard Model, black hole thermodynamics, and cosmological observables without assuming spacetime as a fundamental input.

This repository contains the LaTeX manuscript, simulation data, code modules, and reproducibility assets.

Reproducibility
All numerical results are derived from open-source code and verified via simulation. The included pipeline covers:
	•	Fusion rule enforcement and associativity checks
